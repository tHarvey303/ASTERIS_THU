# ASTERIS: Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising
# Author: Yuduo Guo, Hao Zhang, Mingyu Li

# ASTERIS is a deep learning framework for pushing the detection limit of astronomical 
# imaging, with a focus on spatiotemporal denoising across multi-exposure observations. 
# It is built upon and extends the architecture of 
# [Restormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09881) by introducing temporal modeling and 
# adaptive restoration tailored for scientific image sequences.
# We sincerely thank the original authors of Restormer for making their code and design 
# publicly available.
